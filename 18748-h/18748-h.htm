<p>The City of Victoria is situated on the southern end of Vancouver
Island, in the Province of British Columbia, Canada, and is the capital
of the Province.</p>

<p>In common with all cities of the extreme West, its growth has
been very rapid within the last few years. The population of the
city proper, together with that of the municipality of Oak Bay, immediately
adjacent, is now about 35,000.</p>

<p>The Victoria water-works are owned by the city and operated under
the direction of a Water Commissioner appointed by the City Council.
By special agreement, water is supplied to Oak Bay in bulk, this
municipality having its own distributing system.</p>

<p>The rapid increase in population, together with the fact that in
recent years very little had been done toward increasing the water
supply, resulted in the necessity for remodeling the entire system, and
there are very few cities where this would involve as many complex
problems or a greater variety of work.</p>

<p>Water is drawn from Elk Lake, situated about five miles north of
the city; thence it flows by gravity to the pumping station about four
miles distant, and from there is pumped directly to the consumers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
The remodeling of the system, as recently completed, provided for:</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Increasing the capacity of Elk Lake by a system of levees.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Increasing the capacity of the main to the pumping station by
replacing about two miles of the old 16-in., wrought-iron, riveted pipe
with 24-in. riveted steel pipe.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Increasing the capacity of the pumping station by the installation
of a 4,500,000-gal. pumping engine of the close-connected, cross-compound,
Corliss, crank-and-fly-wheel type.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The construction of a 20,000,000-gal. concrete-lined distributing
reservoir in the city.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The entire remodeling of the distributing system, necessitating
the laying of about 1/2 mile each of 18-in. and 27-in. pipe, and about
1 mile of 24-in. riveted steel pipe; also about 3,000 tons of cast-iron
pipe, varying in size from 4 to 12 in.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;The provision for a high-level service by means of an elevated
tank of approximately 100,000 gal. capacity, water being supplied to
the tank by two electrically-driven triplex pumps, each having a capacity
of 100,000 gal. per 24 hours, against a dynamic head of 150 ft., and
arranged to start and stop automatically with a variation of 3 ft. in
the elevation of the water in the tank. These pumps are located about
one mile from the tower, and are controlled by a float-operated auto-start,
in the base of the tower.</p>

<p>A description of the elevated tank, which is novel in design, with
the reasons for adopting the type of structure used, the method of construction,
and the detailed cost, form the basis of this paper.</p>

<p>The tower is on the top of the highest hill in the city, in the heart
of the most exclusive residential district, beautiful homes clustering
about its base. The necessity for architectural treatment of the
structure is thus seen to be of prime importance. In fact, the opposition
of the local residents to the ordinary type of elevated tank, that
is, latticed columns supporting a tank with a hemispherical bottom
and a conical roof, rendered its use impossible, although tenders were
invited on such a structure.</p>

<p>It is believed that under the conditions of location, three types
of structure should be considered: First, an all-steel structure, the
ornamentation being produced by casing in with brick or concrete;
second, a brick-and-steel, or a concrete-and-steel, structure, such as the
one actually erected; third, a typical reinforced concrete structure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Considering only that portion below the tank, the amount of
material required to case in a structure of the first type would be substantially
the same as that used to support the tank in a structure of
the second type. Consequently, the steel substructure, for all practical
purposes, would represent a dead loss, and, therefore, the economy of
this type is open to serious question.</p>

<p>A tender was received for a reinforced concrete structure identical
in outward appearance with the one built, but, owing to the natural
conservatism of the local residents regarding this type of construction,
it was not acceptable.</p>

<p>The tower, as built, consists of a hollow cylinder of plain concrete,
109 ft. high, and having an inside diameter of 22 ft. The walls
are 10 in. thick for the first 70 ft. and 6 in. thick for the remaining
39 ft., and are ornamented with six pilasters (70 ft. high, 3 ft. wide,
and 7 in. thick), a 4-ft. belt, then twelve pilasters (12 ft. high, 18 in.
wide, and 7 in. thick), a cornice, and a parapet wall.</p>

<p>A steel tank of the ordinary type is embedded in the upper 40 ft.
of this cylinder. To form the bottom of this tank, a plain concrete
dome is thrown across the cylinder at a point about 70 ft. from the
base, the thrust of this dome being taken up by two steel rings, 1/2 in.
by 14 in. and 3/8 in. by 18 in., bedded into the walls of the tower, the
latter ring being riveted to the lower course of the tank.</p>

<p>The tank is covered with a roof of reinforced concrete, 4 in. thick,
conical in shape, and reinforced with 1/2-in. twisted steel bars. The
design of the structure is clearly shown in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>The tower is built on out-cropping, solid rock. This rock was
roughly stepped, and a concrete sub-base built. This sub-base consists
of a hollow ring, with an inside diameter of 20 ft., the walls being
5 ft. thick. It is about 2 ft. high on one side and 7 ft. high on the other,
and forms a level base on which the tower is built. The forms for this
sub-base consist of vertical lagging and circumferential ribs. The
lagging is of double-dressed, 2 by 3-in. segments, and the ribs are of
2 by 12-in. segments, 6 ft. long, lapping past one another and securely
spiked together to form complete or partial circles. These ribs are
2 ft. from center to center.</p>

</div>

<p>Similar construction was used to form the taper base of the tower
proper, except, of course, that the radii of the segments forming the
successive ribs decreased with the height of the rib. Tapered lagging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
was used, being made by double dressing 2 by 6-in. pieces to 1-3/4 by
5-13/16 in., and ripping on a diagonal, thus making two staves, 3 in. wide
at one end and 2-3/4 in. wide at the other. This tapered lagging was
used again on the 4-ft. belt and cornice forms, the taper being turned
alternately up and down.</p>

</div>

<p>The interior diameter being uniform up to the bottom of the dome,
collapsible forms were used from the beginning. These forms were
constructed in six large sections, 6 ft. high, with one small key
section with wedge piece to facilitate stripping, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>.
There were three tiers of these, bolted end to end horizontally and to
each other vertically.</p>

<p>Above the taper base and except in the 4-ft. belt and cornice,
collapsible forms were used on the outside also. There were six sections
extending from column to column and six column sections, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
bolted together circumferentially and constructed as shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>.
Three tiers of these were also bolted together both vertically and
horizontally.</p>

<p>Having filled the top tier, the mode of operation was as follows:</p>

<p>All horizontal bolts in the lower inside and outside forms were
removed, as was also the small key section on the inside; this left
each section suspended to the corresponding one immediately above
it by the vertical bolts before mentioned. It is thus seen that in each
case the center tier performed the double duty of holding the upper
tier, which was full of green concrete, and the sections of the lower
tier, until they were hoisted up and again placed in position to be
filled.</p>

<p>These lower forms were then hoisted by hand&mdash;four-part tackles
being used&mdash;and placed in position on the top forms, their bottom
edges being carefully set flush with the top edge of the form already
in position, and then bolted to it. On the outside, the column forms,
and on the inside, the wedge and key sections were set last. A 3-lb.
plumb-bob on a fine line was suspended from the inner scaffold and
carefully centered over a point set in the rock at the base. This line
was in the exact center of the tower, and the tops of all the forms,
after each shift, were carefully set from it by measurement, thus keeping
the structure plumb.</p>

<p>The first 23 in. of the barrel of the tower was moulded with special
outside forms, constructed so as to form the bases of the large pilasters.
After eleven applications of the 6-ft. forms, these 23-in. sections were
reversed to form the capitals, thus making these pilasters, 69 ft. 10 in.
over all.</p>

<p>The forms of the 4-ft. belt and beading were made in twelve sections
of simple segments and vertical lagging, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>Two sets of the outside forms were split longitudinally, as shown
in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>, and used to form the small pilasters. The first set was put
in place, filled, and the concrete allowed to harden. The bolts were
loosened and the forms raised 5-1/2 in. vertically, again bolted up, and
the second set was placed in position, bringing the top of the second
set up to the bottom of the cornice. The bases and capitals of the
small pilasters were moulded on afterward.</p>

<p>The cornice forms are clearly shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>. The small boxes
separating the dentils are made of light stuff, and tacked into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
cornice forms so that, in stripping, they would remain in place and
could be taken out separately, in order to prevent breaking off
the corners of the dentils. A number of outside and inside sections
were sawed in half horizontally in order to provide forms for the
parapet wall.</p>

<p>The inside diameter of the tank is 8 in. greater than the inside
diameter of the base. Two sets of inside forms were split longitudinally
and opened out, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>, and another small section
was added to complete the circle. The remaining set was left in
place to support the dome forms.</p>

<p>The dome forms were made in twelve sections, bolted together
to facilitate stripping. All ribs and segments were cut to size on the
ground, put together in place, and then covered with lagging and two-ply
tar paper. The lagging on the lower sharp curve was formed of
a double thickness of 3/8-in. spruce, the remainder being 1 by 4-in. pine,
sized to a uniform thickness of 7/8 in. <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> shows the construction
of these forms and the method of putting on the lagging.</p>

<p>The roof forms were made in eight sections and bolted together
to facilitate stripping. All ribs and segments were cut to size on the
ground, put together in place, and covered with 1 by 4-in. lagging,
dressed to a uniform thickness of 7/8 in., and two-ply tar paper. <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>
shows the construction of these forms. The segments being put in
horizontally instead of square with the lagging, gave circles instead
of parabolas, making them much easier to lay out, and giving a form
which was amply stiff.</p>

<p>The question of using an inside scaffold only was carefully considered,
but owing to the considerable amount of ornamentation on
the outside, necessitating a large number of individual forms, it was
not thought that any economy would result.</p>

<p><a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a> and Figs. <a href="#plate23_fig1">1</a> and <a href="#plate23_fig2">2</a>, Plate XXIII, show clearly the construction
of the scaffolding.</p>

<p>All concrete was mixed wet, in a motor-driven, Smith mixer, and
handled off the outside scaffold, being sent up in wheel-barrows on
the ordinary contractor's hoist and placed in the forms through an
iron chute having a hopper mouth. This chute was built in three sections
bolted together, either one, two, or three sections being used,
depending on the distance of the forms below the deck. When the top
of the forms reached the elevation of any deck, the concrete was put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
in through the chute from the deck above. The chute was light and
easily shifted by the wheel-barrow men, assisted by the man placing
the concrete, during the interval between successive wheel-barrows.</p>

<p>The concrete, except that for the roof and parapet, was composed
of sand and broken rock, the run of the crusher being used. That for
the roof and parapet was composed of sand and gravel. The only
reason for using gravel for the concrete of the roof was the ease with
which it could be obtained in small quantities, the supply of broken
rock having been used up, and this being the last concrete work to
be done.</p>

<p>The concrete used was as follows: 1:3:6 for the sub-base and taper
base; 1:3:5 for the barrel of the tower and tank casing; and 1:2:4
for the dome and roof. The dome was put in at one time, there being
no joint, the same being true of the roof. Vancouver Portland cement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
manufactured on the island about 15 miles from the city, was used
throughout the work.</p>

<p>Before filling, the inside of the tank was given a plaster coat, consisting
of 1 part cement to 1-3/4 parts of fine sand. This proved to be
insufficient to prevent leakage, the water seeping through the dome
and appearing on the outside of the structure along the line of the
bottom of the rings. Three more coats were then applied over the
entire tank, and two additional ones over the dome and about 8 ft.
up on the sides, and, except for one or two small spots which show
just a sign of moisture, the tank is perfectly tight.</p>

<p>The barrel of the tower was carried up to a height of 66 ft. A special
set of inside forms, about 2 ft. high, extending to the springing line
of the dome, was then put in, and the dome forms were set up on it.
The idea was that this 2-ft. form could be knocked out piece by piece
and the weight of the dome form taken on wedges to the last 6-ft.
form, these wedges being gradually slackened down in order to allow
the dome form to settle clear of the dome. As a matter of fact, this
was done, but the dome forms, being very tight, did not settle, and
had to be pried off a section at a time. A similar method was used
for slacking down the roof forms, with similar results.</p>

<p>After the dome forms had been put in, the concrete was carried
up approximately to the elevation of the bottom of the rings. Small
neat cement pads were then put in and accurately leveled, and on these
the steel rings were placed, and the steel tank was erected.</p>

<p>In order to insure a perfectly round tank, each course was erected
against wooden templates accurately centered and fastened to the inside
scaffold. The tank is the ordinary type of light steel, the lower
course being 3/16-in., the next, No. 8 B.&nbsp;w. gauge, the next, No. 10
B.&nbsp;w. gauge, and the remaining four, No. 12 B.&nbsp;w. gauge.</p>

<p>Work on the foundation was started on August 15th, 1908, and the
tower was not completed until April 1st, 1909. Much time was lost
waiting for the delivery of the steel, and also owing to a period of very
cold weather which caused entire cessation of work for about one
month.</p>

<p>The tower as completed presents a striking appearance. In order
to obliterate rings due to the successive application of the forms and
to cover the efflorescence so common to concrete structures, the outside
was given two coats of neat cement wash applied with ordinary calcimining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
brushes, and, up to the present time, this seems to have been
very effective in accomplishing the desired result.</p>

<p>Irregularities due to forms are unnoticeable at a distance of 200
or 300 ft., and the grouting gave a very uniform color.</p>

<p>The application of two coats of cement wash cost, for labor, $97.68,
and for material, $15.18, or $1.32 per 100 sq. ft., labor being at the
rate of $2.25 per 8 hours and cement costing $2.53 per bbl. delivered
on the work.</p>

<p>The tower was designed by Arthur L. Adams, M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.,
under whose direction the plans for all the work of remodeling the
water-works system were prepared and executed. The forms, scaffolding,
etc., were designed by the writer, who was also in immediate
charge of the erection.</p>

<p>Tenders received for the construction of the tower covered an
extremely wide range, and indicated at once the utter lack of knowledge
on the part of the bidders of the cost of a structure of this kind.
Inasmuch as none of them had had previous experience in this class of
construction, the engineer deemed it the part of wisdom and economy
to retain the construction under his immediate supervision, and, therefore,
the work was done by days' labor.</p>

<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> gives the cost of the structure. The total herein given
will not coincide with the total cost as shown by the city's books, for
the reason that various items not properly chargeable to the structure
itself have been omitted, the principal ones of which are the cost of the
site, the laying of about 600 ft. of sewer pipe to connect with the overflow,
and considerable expense incident to the construction of a wagon
road to the tower.</p>

<p>The rates of wages paid, all being on a basis of an 8-hour day, were
as follows:</p>

</table></div>


<p>All these prices are for material delivered on the work.</p>

<p>An examination of the cost data, as given, will show that for the
most part the unit costs are very high. This is due chiefly to the continued
interruption of the work, during its later stages, owing to bad
weather, particularly in the case of the erection of the steel tank.
The material cost in this case was also exceedingly high.</p>

<p>In the case of the concreting, inability to purchase a hoist and
motor and the high cost of renting the same, together with the delays
mentioned, added greatly to the unit cost.</p>

<p>When it is considered that the cost of plastering covers that of
four coats over the entire inside of the tank and three more over about
one-third of it, it does not appear so high, especially in view of the
high rate of wages paid.</p>

<p>The cost per yard for concrete alone was $25.126, and this is
probably about 25% in excess of the cost of the same class of work
executed under more favorable conditions as to location, weather conditions,
etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="DISCUSSION" id="DISCUSSION"></a>DISCUSSION</h2>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Maurice C. Couchot, M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.</span> (by letter).&mdash;It appears to
the writer that in the design of this structure two features are open
to criticism. The first is that such a high structure was built of plain
concrete without any reinforcement. Even if the computation of
stresses did not show the necessity for steel reinforcement, some should
have been embedded in the work. As a matter of fact, the writer
believes that, with the present knowledge of the benefit of reinforced
concrete, a structure such as this should not be built without it. This
applies mainly to the tower below the tank.</p>

<p>The second feature, which is still more important, refers to the
insertion of a shell of smooth steel plate to take the stresses due to the
hydrostatic pressure, and also to insure against leakage in the walls
of the tank. The 6-in. shell of plain concrete outside the steel shell,
and the 3-in. shell inside, do not work together, and are practically of
no value as walls, but are simply outside and inside linings. Although
the designer provided lugs to insure the adhesion of the concrete to
the plate, such precaution, in the writer's opinion, will not prevent
the separation of the concrete from the smooth steel plate, and, at
some future time, the water will reach and corrode the steel. It
would have been better to have reinforced the wall of the tank with
rods, as is generally done. The full thickness would have been available,
and less plastering would have been required. Furthermore, the
adhesion of concrete to a smooth steel plate is of doubtful value, for,
in reinforced concrete, it is not the adhesion which does the work,
but the gripping of the steel by the concrete in the process of setting.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">L.&nbsp;J. Mensch, M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.</span> (by letter).&mdash;This water-tower
is probably the sightliest structure of its kind in North America;
still, it does not look like a water-tower, and, from an architectural
point of view, the crown portion is faulty, because it makes the tank
appear to be much less in depth than it really is.</p>

<p>The cost of this structure far exceeds that of similar tanks in the
United States. The stand-pipe at Attleboro, 50 ft. in diameter and
100 ft. high, cost about $25,000. Several years ago the writer proposed
to build an elevated tank, 60 ft. in diameter and 40 ft. deep, the bottom
of which was to be 50 ft. above the ground, for $21,000.</p>

<p>Among other elevated tanks known to the writer is one having a
capacity of 100,000 gal., the bottom being 60 ft. above the ground.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
The total quantities of material required for this tank are given as
4,480 cu. ft. of concrete, 23,200 lb. of reinforcing steel, and 27,600 ft.,
b.&nbsp;m., of form lumber and staging. Calculating at the abnormally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
high unit prices of 40 cents per cu. ft. for concrete, 4 cents per lb.
for steel, and $50 per 1,000 ft., b.&nbsp;m., for lumber, the cost of the concrete
would be $1,792, the steel, $928, and the form lumber and staging,
$1,380. Adding to this the cost of a spiral staircase, at the high
figure of $7 per linear foot in height, the total cost of this structure
would be $4,598. The factor of safety used in this structure was
four, but some engineers who are not familiar with concrete construction
may require a higher factor. By doubling the quantities of concrete
and steel, which would mean a tensile stress in the steel of only
8,000 lb. per sq. in., and a compressive stress in the concrete of only
225 lb. per sq. in., the cost of the tank would be only $7,318, as compared
with the $16,578 mentioned in the paper. This enormous discrepancy
between a good design and an amateur design, and between day-labor
work and contract work should be a lesson which consulting engineers
and managers of large corporations, who prefer their own designs and
day-labor work, should take to heart.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;H. Markwart, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.</span> (by letter).&mdash;It is the
writer's opinion that the steel tank enclosed within the concrete of the
upper cylinder, to take up the hoop tension and presumably to provide
a water-tight tower, will not fulfill this latter requirement. If a
plastered surface on the dome-shaped bottom provided the necessary
imperviousness, it would seem that plastered walls would have proved
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Apparently, the sheet-metal tank is intended to exclude the possibility
of exterior leakage, but it occurs to the writer that it will fail to
be efficient in this particular, because, under pressure, the water will
force itself under the steel tank and the dome thrust rings and out
to the exterior of the tower just below the tank, thus showing that
insurance against leakage is actually provided by the plastered interior
surfaces and not by the sheet-metal tank, and, for this reason, ordinary
deformed rod reinforcement, in the writer's opinion, would have
proved cheaper and better, and more in line with other parts of the
reinforcement.</p>

<p>Mr. Kempkey states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Before filling, the inside of the tank was given a plaster coat,
consisting of 1 part cement to 1-3/4 parts of fine sand. This proved
to be insufficient to prevent leakage, the water seeping through the
dome and appearing on the outside of the structure along the line
of the bottom of the rings. Three more coats were then applied
over the entire tank, and two additional ones over the dome and about
8 ft. up on the sides, and, except for one or two small spots which
show just a sign of moisture, the tank is perfectly tight."</p></div>

<p>This substantiates the writer's contention that water-tightness was
actually obtained by a liberal use of cement plaster, which would also
have been true had the reinforcement been rods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>As a further comment, it might be stated that a water-tight concrete
for the tank could have been obtained by adding from 8 to 10%
of hydrated lime to the 1:2:4 mixture. This seems advisable in all
cases where a water-tight concrete is necessary. The interior plastering
could then have been done as a further precaution.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">A. Kempkey, Jr., Jun. Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E.</span> (by letter).&mdash;Mr. Couchot's
statement, that the 3-in. inside and outside sheets forming the tank
casing do not act together, is quite true, and it was not expected that
they would, other than to protect the steel and form an ornamental
covering for it.</p>

<p>There is certainly adhesion between concrete and steel, even though
the steel be in the form of a thin shell, and in a structure of this
kind where the steel is designed, with a low unit stress, to take all
the strain, and where the load is at all times quiescent, it is difficult
to see how this bond can be destroyed; the writer feels no concern
on this score.</p>

<p>Mr. Markwart's statement, that the steel tank enclosed within the
concrete of the upper cylinder, presumably to provide a water-tight
tower, will not fulfill this latter requirement, is not true, as shown
by the statement in the paper that the only leakage which occurred
was that which passed under the tank, the entire remaining portion
being absolutely tight. The amount of leakage, while insignificant,
was, until remedied, sufficient to spot the outside of the tower, making
it unsightly; and this, in the writer's opinion, is just what would have
happened had the tank been constructed in the ordinary manner, with
deformed bars, except that it would have extended over more or less
of the entire surface, instead of being localized, as was actually the
case, and would have required more instead of less plastering. It is
also doubtful whether the addition of hydrated lime would have produced
a tight tank, in the sense that this structure was required to
be tight.</p>

<p>In the paper the writer endeavored to bring out the fact that this
is one of the few instances where the &aelig;sthetic design of a structure of
this sort is of prime importance, and cost a secondary consideration.
There is, therefore, no use in comparing its cost with that of a structure
in no way its equal in this respect and the use of which would
not have been permitted any more than the use of the ordinary type
of steel structure, even though the estimated cost were 75% less.</p>

<p>Mr. Mensch has been pleased to term this design amateurish,
presumably because of the conservative character of the stresses used
and because of its cost; at the same time, he sets up the design to
which he makes reference as a good one simply because of its cheapness.
He will find the "enormous discrepancy," to which he calls attention,
accounted for by the fact that the "good design" would not have
been tolerated because of its appearance and because of the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the excessively high unit stresses, of which Mr. Mensch is an exponent,
did not commend themselves either to the designer, in common with
most engineers, or to Victorian taste; while the design used has proven
eminently satisfactory to a more than usually conservative and discriminating
community.</p>

<p>Mr. Mensch's statement of unit costs, even though applied to a
much plainer structure, is not calculated to inspire confidence in the
soundness of his deductions in any one familiar with Victoria conditions.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
